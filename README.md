# EE541 Final Project-Chord_Recognition
## Project Document
- Data & Plots Folder
    - Audio_Files: This folder contains all the audio data for training, testing, and validation.
    - Plots: are the graphs we generate during tuning hyperparameters and testing
- Code & Models
    - Chord_Recognition_DL_Approach.ipynb
        - This code file includes the architecture of our convolutional neural network, data preprocessing, and neural network training.
    - Chord_Recognition_ML_Approach.ipynb
        - This code file contains our traditional machine learning algorithm, and the results generated by it serve as the baseline for this project.
